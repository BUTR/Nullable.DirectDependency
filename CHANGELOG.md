# Changelog

# v1.1.1

This release adds the `// <auto-generated>` header to the `NullableAttributes.cs` file so that
code analyzers like StyleCop ignore the file during the static code analysis.
Thanks to [@skarllot](https://github.com/skarllot) for suggesting and making this change!


# v1.1.0

This release updates the package, so that the attributes file is no longer included in projects
targeting a framework >= .NET Standard 2.1.
For any target version below, the file is still automatically included.
This ensures that the package can easily be installed in libraries which are multi-targeting
different frameworks, without them having to define conditional compilation constants.

In addition, a small typo in the XML documentation was fixed.
